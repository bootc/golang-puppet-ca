// SECURITY: pins the quoting of certnames in `list`'s table.
//
// An earlier version of this change exempted the table on the grounds that
// quoting would wreck its column alignment. That was false: printTable derives
// its width from the strings it is handed, so quoting before the row is built
// leaves the columns correct. These specs pin both halves of that -- the names
// are escaped, and the table still lines up -- so the exemption cannot come
// back on a rationale that does not hold.
