// k8sExportRetryInterval is how long a failed export cycle waits before it is
// retried. Exports are otherwise driven only by startup and CRL updates, which
// on a low-churn CA can be weeks apart, so without a retry a single transient
// storage or API-server error leaves every target holding a stale CA
// certificate or CRL until the CRL next changes.
//
// Two minutes sits well inside k8sExportFailingFor (15m), the debounce on
// PuppetCAKubernetesExportFailing: a cycle that recovers on the first retry or
// two resolves before the alert would have paged, while one that keeps failing
// keeps re-stamping last_error and stays firing. A failure that outlasts the
// debounce still pages, as it should.
//
// Deliberate consequence, not an oversight: a target that fails its first
// attempt and succeeds on retry every cycle never pages, because last_success
// always overtakes last_error inside the debounce. Before this retry existed
// such a target did page. See docs/kubernetes-export.md.

// startK8sExport constructs the exporter and starts its job, or -- if it cannot
// be constructed -- makes that failure reportable.
//
// The failure branch is why this is a function rather than wiring in its
// caller. newExporter fails when there is no in-cluster client to build or no
// pod namespace to resolve, and the CA then carries on serving with readiness
// green while the configured targets silently freeze at whatever they last
// held. Publishing the apply counters at zero is what turns that into something
// PuppetCAKubernetesExportNotRunning can match; the log line alone reaches
// nobody who is not already reading logs.
//
// newExporter is a parameter so a spec can drive both branches. This lived
// inside a cobra RunE before, which meant the one line closing that alerting
// gap could be deleted without a single test noticing.

// cleanup), so CRL-bearing objects stay current.
//
// A cycle in which any target failed is retried after retryInterval, and keeps
// being retried until one succeeds completely. The CRL-update signal alone is
// not enough: it can be weeks away on a quiet CA, which would leave a target
// stale for that long after a momentary failure.
