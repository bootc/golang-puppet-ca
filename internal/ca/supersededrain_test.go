// drainDueLocked is the seam issue #176 replaces when it batches the CRL
// re-sign. These specs pin the contract that replacement has to keep, so the
// batched version is checked against a property rather than against the shape
// of the loop it replaces.
//
// The property is drainOutcome's total: every entry handed in comes back in
// exactly one disposition. An entry that falls out of all four is a certificate
// left valid with nothing recording that it should not be — which is precisely
// the defect review round 2 found here, where deferred entries were named in
// the log line and then dropped from the write-back. A scenario spec caught
// that one after the fact; this one states the invariant it violated.
// recordSuperseded is what makes the stored form canonical. Its two callers
// disagree: AutoRenew passes serialHexStr of the presented certificate, already
// canonical, while Renew passes LatestSerialForSubject, which returns inventory
// text verbatim — and a migrated or older inventory carries zero-padded
// serials. Only a white-box call can feed it a genuinely non-canonical value:
// a spec driving Renew against a fresh store cannot, because that store's
// inventory is already canonical, which is precisely how a spec written that
// way passes whether or not the canonicalisation exists.
