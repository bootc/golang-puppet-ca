// A crl_chain_file whose read never returns must not hold the cluster CRL lock.
//
// Both call sites reach this read under lockNameCRL and c.mu, and that lock
// serialises revocation across every replica -- so one replica stuck inside
// os.Open or io.ReadAll wedges CRL maintenance fleet-wide, with every other
// replica timing out against LockTimeout while this one never releases.
//
// The size caps do not help: they bound how much the file may contain, not how
// long reading it may take. A FIFO with no writer is the cheapest faithful
// stand-in for the real cause -- a wedged CSI driver, an NFS volume whose
// server has gone, a sidecar that stopped writing -- because os.Open on it
// blocks until a writer appears, which is exactly a read that never returns.
