# Regression suite for test/migration/http-helpers.sh.
#
# The helpers exist so that a failed request in the migration suite leaves
# behind the evidence needed to explain it (issue #208).  That claim is only
# worth anything if it holds for the failures that actually happen, so this
# suite drives the helpers against a real curl talking to a real socket that
# fails in the specific ways the migration suite has seen: a transfer
# truncated mid-flight, a connection refused, a 5xx, a 404, an empty body, a
# hangup before the response line, a stall after the headers, and a failed TLS
# handshake -- including all three classes #208 named as indistinguishable.
#
# It also pins the half of the change that is logic rather than reporting:
# http_get_retry must retry a transport failure, must retry a 200 whose body
# is not what was asked for, must stop on the first success, and must not
# retry past its bound.  A retry loop that quietly never retried would look
# identical to a working one on a green run.
#
# Runs on the CI host rather than inside the test-runner container -- what is
# under test is the shell logic, and the container image carries no Python to
# host the fake server with.  Requires bash, curl and python3.
#
# Usage (from project root):
#   bash test/migration/http-helpers-test.sh
#
# Output: TAP.  Exit 0 when all pass, 1 if any fail.
