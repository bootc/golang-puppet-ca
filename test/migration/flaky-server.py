"""A deliberately unreliable HTTP server, for http-helpers-test.sh.

Reproduces the transport-level failures the migration suite's assertions used
to render indistinguishable (issue #208), so the helpers in http-helpers.sh can
be tested against real curl rather than against a mock of it.  In particular it
can answer with a valid status line and Content-Length and then close the
connection early -- the truncated-transfer case that made curl exit 18 while
the server's own log recorded a clean 200.

Speaks HTTP/1.0 over a raw socket rather than using http.server, because a
truncated response needs control the framework does not give.

Usage:
    flaky-server.py PORTFILE BEHAVIOUR...

PORTFILE is written with the bound port once the socket is listening; the
caller polls for it rather than guessing a port.  BEHAVIOURs are consumed one
per request, and the last one repeats forever once the list runs out, so
`flaky-server.py p truncate ok` serves one truncated response and then answers
normally for the rest of the run.

Behaviours:
    ok          200 with a PEM-shaped body
    truncate    200, honest Content-Length, half the body, then close
    500         500 with a short HTML error body
    empty       200 with Content-Length: 0
    hangup      close the connection without writing anything
    notfound    404 with a short body
    stall       200 and an honest Content-Length, then never send the body
